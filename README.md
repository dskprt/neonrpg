## map editor
download the map editor from [here](https://github.com/dskprt/neonrpg/raw/main/nanoedit/nanoedit.7z) 

to make it work, you need to build the project and place `neonrpg.dll` in the same folder as the `nanoedit.exe` executable 

`(not distributing the source code because I wrote it very quickly and the code is disgusting)`
